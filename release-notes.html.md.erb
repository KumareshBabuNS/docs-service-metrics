# <a id="release-notes"></a> 1.5.4

## <a id="new-features"></a>New Features

- The ability for metrics adapters to indicate that the service is not yet ready to return metrics, but to try again on the schedule.
  - Implement this feature by returning a `10` exit code from your metrics adapter.
- The service metrics adapter `metrics_command` is automatically detected if placed in a default location.
  - `/var/vcap/jobs/service-metrics-adapter/bin/collect-service-metrics` is the default.
  - Best practice is to template any command arguments into a script that is placed at the default location.
  - Script should be executable by `vcap`.
- `metrics_command_args` is now optional, best practice is to use the default command location and template arguments into a script, as described above.
- Info logging to indicate the metrics collection has started and finished.
- Verified BOSH release against a TLS enabled Metron environment
